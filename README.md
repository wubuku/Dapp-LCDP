# A Dapp Low-Code Development Platform

English | [中文](README_CN.md)


[ToC]

## What we want to do

A **true** Low-code development platform (LCDP) that helps developers build decentralized applications ( Dapps ) that maximize the use of blockchains as technical infrastructure.

A low-code development platform that allows developers to build extremely complex decentralized applications with experiences that are very close to developing "traditional" applications.

In the initial phase, the platform will prioritize support for building Dapps running on the Move public blockchain.

In the longer term, the platform does not restrict developers to use any programming language to build Dapps, allowing them to focus on the implementation of the "business logic". Thus, developers of "traditional" applications can more easily enjoy the dividends of blockchain development; while "traditional" enterprise software and Web 2.0 Internet applications, which are already highly complex, can be migrated onto blockchains at low cost and become decentralized Web 3.0 applications.

## What is a "true" low-code development platform

"What is this 'true' low-code development platform you speak of?"

Here we think it is necessary to clarify the difference between "low-code" and "no-code". No-code refers more to a category of "end-user" oriented tools through which users can quickly assemble certain applications; for example, some Internet form tools, website building tools, etc. The low-code platform, on the other hand, we think is for professional developers.

We believe that a true low-code development platform should have the following key features.

* **Model driven** development. These models should ideally be "domain models" that are as far from "technology" and as close to "business" as possible. Because "communication" is the biggest cost in complex software development - even if the low-code platform is for developers and the "no-code" is for end users (business people).

* **Visual Development**. Visual modeling tools are an important part of the visual development toolbox for low-code platforms. However, it should be noted that if the modeling tool can save the model as a well-readable plain text, then the specification of this text is actually a DSL (domain-specific language), and such a DSL can actually be written manually by the developer (without the help of a visual modeling tool).

* Support the use of **expression languages**. An expression language should be simpler and easier to write business logic in than the general-purpose language (GPL). It should be functional programming style; it should be as declarative as possible - that is, for expressing "what is wanted" rather than "how it is done".

* **Systematic software engineering support**. The low-code platform should integrate best practices in the areas of software engineering including development, debug, testing, version control, DevOps, etc.

* **Applications are open to integration and are extensible**. Applications developed by low-code platforms should have open APIs as well as the ability to use external APIs and be extensible using general-purpose languages.
